-- Another way to represent stream processors is using the datatype:
data Stream b c = Put c (Stream b c) | Get (b -> Stream b c)
-- where Put b f represents a stream processor that is ready to output c and
-- continue with f, and Get k represents a stream processor waiting for an
-- input b, which will continue by passing it to k.
-- Stream processors are them constructed using the following continuation 
-- style operations for these actions:
put :: c -> Stream b c -> Stream b c
put = Put
-- which constructs a stream processor which outputs the b and them behaves
-- like the second argument, and
get :: (b -> Stream b c) -> Stream b c
get = Get
-- which constructs a stream processor which waits for an input, passes it
-- to its function argument, and them behaves like the result.
-- Stream processors can be interpreted as stream functions by the function:
runStream :: Stream b c -> [b] -> [c]
runStream (Put c s) bs 	   = c : runStream s bs
runStream (Get k)   (b:bs) = runStream (k b) bs
runStream (Get k)   [] 	   = []
-- We concern ourselfs for the time being with processes that have one input
-- channel and one output channel. 
-- For simplicity we shall only consider non-terminating (recursively defined) 
-- stream processors; otherwise we would add another operator to construct a
-- stream processor which halts.
